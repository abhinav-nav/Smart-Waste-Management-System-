Problem Statement:
Our aim is to create a Smart Waste Management System that helps to optimize the waste collection process and provide real-time monitoring of waste levels in trash cans. The goal is to reduce the time and resources required for waste collection and ensure that the waste is disposed of in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way.

UN Sustainable Development Goal and Target:
The UN Sustainable Development Goal 11, "Sustainable Cities and Communities," specifically target 11.6, "By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management." Our Smart Waste Management System aims to address this target by optimizing waste collection and reducing the negative environmental impact of waste disposal.

Implementation:

Architecture:
Our Smart Waste Management System architecture consists of three main components: the hardware component, the software component, and the cloud platform.

Hardware Component:
The hardware component comprises of smart sensors that are attached to trash cans. These sensors detect the level of waste in the trash can and send the data to the cloud platform. The sensors are equipped with IoT technology and can communicate with other devices in the system.

Software Component:
The software component comprises of a mobile app that allows the waste management staff to monitor the waste levels in real-time and optimize the waste collection process accordingly. The software component also includes a machine learning algorithm that can predict the fill levels of trash cans and optimize the collection schedule.

Cloud Platform:
The cloud platform is responsible for storing and processing the data collected by the smart sensors. The cloud platform also includes a dashboard that provides real-time monitoring and reporting of waste levels and collection schedules.

Technologies, Programming languages, and Tools used:
For the hardware component, we will use IoT sensors that can communicate with other devices in the system. For the software component, we will use programming languages such as Java, Kotlin, and Swift for Android and iOS development. For the cloud platform, we will use cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to store and process data.

Feedback / Testing / Iteration:
We will test our solution with real users, including waste management staff and residents of the city. We will gather feedback on the ease of use, accuracy of data, and effectiveness of waste collection. Based on the feedback, we will make improvements to the software algorithm and optimize the waste collection schedule.

Challenge:
One challenge we may face is ensuring that the sensors are durable and can withstand harsh environmental conditions. To address this issue, we will use high-quality sensors and conduct thorough testing to ensure that they are reliable and durable.

Success and Completion of Solution:
Our Smart Waste Management System will help to optimize waste collection and reduce the negative environmental impact of waste disposal. We will measure the success of our solution by tracking the amount of waste collected and the reduction in resources required for waste collection. We will use tools such as data analytics and visualization to understand the impact of our solution on the environment and the community.

Scalability / Next Steps:
The next steps for our project include scaling the solution to cover more areas of the city and collaborating with waste management organizations to implement our solution in other cities. We will also explore the possibility of integrating our solution with other smart city systems, such as smart traffic management and public transportation systems.

Technical Architecture Scalability:
Our solution is highly scalable and can support a larger audience with minor changes. We can increase the number of sensors and add more cloud servers to handle the increased data load. We can also optimize the software algorithm to handle a larger number of trash cans and improve the accuracy of data predictions.
